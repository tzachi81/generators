!!! Without generators, async functions are very difficult to handle !!! 

1.  ES6 introduced us generators and promises, and ES8 introduced us async/await.
2.  So, why do we need to understand promises and generators?
    - supporting older platforms.
    - running on older browser versions or older Node.js versions.
3.  browsers also implement async functions in a similar way:
    they transform the async code to use generators and promises, quite similar to Babel.

4. generator functions can yield promises
